# Utility

SAMA is the native token of Exosama Network, meaning you pay gas for transactions of the Exosama Network. Portion of tha gas fee is burned.

SAMA is also a special in game currency in the Dremica game, allowing the players to buy special items, effects, boosts, consumables and modifiers. Currently the in-game SAMA is burned, as per [this community proposal](https://portal.moonsama.com/governance/proposals/9d32f7fc-7b1b-4ee6-8c5a-1e37c45de331).

SAMA holdings of a community member also contribute to the community member's voting power in the estabilished [community governance](/docs/about-moonsama/governance).
