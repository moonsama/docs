# Utility & Inflation

## Inflation

The governance has voted on implementing deflationary tokenomics, eliminating the previous possibility of inflation regarding SAMA's total supply. The team is currently developing a new deflationary tokenomic model, which will be proposed to the governance in the future.

## Token utility

SAMA is the native token of Exosama and Moonsama Network.

SAMA is providing the following utility features:

- SAMA is the gas token of the Moonsama- and Exosama Network. Every transaction, including the deployment/operation of
dApps, costs SAMA to ensure the security of the network. In certain cases the cost of transactions are subsidized in the
form of gasless transactions.
- Exosama Network acts as a platform for issuing new assets, such as in-game assets and NFTs, some of which are to be
paid in SAMA.
- SAMA acts as a governance mechanism and trading currency of the Raresama NFT Marketplace.
- Certain utility-infrastructure and services on top of Moonsama Network are intended to require SAMA for access.
- Moonsama might periodically launch SAMA staking-campaigns, requiring to stake SAMA over a certain period of time to
gain access to certain utilities or events.
- SAMA can be used to reward players for participating in ecosystem activities.
- Participation in on-chain governance can rely on the holding of and/or bonding of SAMA in the future.
