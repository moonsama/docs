# Inflation

Currently there is no inflation taking place, issuance is coming from the Community Fund.

As our previous and current proposition, inflation shall be capped at 10% per year, if any. Note that this can be changed, but
only through the governance mechanisms of the Moonsama Community.

Please follow the passed [community proposals](https://portal.moonsama.com/governance) to keep track of decisions made about SAMA tokenomics.
