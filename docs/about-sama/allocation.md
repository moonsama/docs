## History

SAMA is a fair-launch token, **there was never a sale**. It was earned by players and holders of Pondsama NFT fishes as
$POOP tokens on Moonriver, then it went through a [migration and redenomination](https://portal.moonsama.com/governance/proposals/31672c86-4603-4eeb-bda2-c215086de6ed) giving birth to $xcPOOP on Moonbeam, which finally became convertible to $SAMA following to [this proposal](https://portal.moonsama.com/governance/proposals/cd83137d-0b78-4732-889b-0765749bcff1).

## Crowdloan

Moonsama Community successfully [acquired a parachain slot #42](https://parachains.info/details/moonsama) to build Moonsama Network, which was later discontinued.
Contributors of the auction received SAMA rewards, which details can be found [here](https://medium.com/@MoonsamaNFT/polkadot-crowdloan-for-moonsama-network-is-now-live-ddd61b4be0ff).

Contributors need to bind an EVM address to their contributor Substrate address to start receiving their SAMA rewards on the [Crowdloan Page](https://crowdloan.moonsama.com/).
