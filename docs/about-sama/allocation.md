# History

SAMA is a fair-launch token, **there was never a sale**. It was earned by players and holders of Pondsama NFT fishes as $POOP tokens on Moonriver, then it went through a [migration and redenomination](https://mcapi.moonsama.com/townhall/vote/31672c86-4603-4eeb-bda2-c215086de6ed) giving birth to $xcPOOP on Moonbeam, which finally became convertible to $SAMA following to [this proposal](https://mcapi.moonsama.com/townhall/vote/cd83137d-0b78-4732-889b-0765749bcff1).
