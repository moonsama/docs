# About

Exosama network is the production EVM chain of Moonsama.

Exosama Network is optimized to be a cost-effective and high-performance EVM chain that hosts some of the key Moonsama products. As a multi-chain ecosystem, we maintain independence from any single blockchain. Given our extensive portfolio of on-chain assets and applications, establishing our own base trust layer was essential to eliminate dependencies on third-party protocol developers and external tokens for gas fee payments.
