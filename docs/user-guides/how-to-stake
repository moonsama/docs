# How to stake?

See below for step-by-step instructions on how to participate in Moonsama's staking campaigns.

- Moonsama and trusted third-party developers can host various staking campaigns within Moonsama's ecosystem.
- Ecosystem participants can join in these campaigns, each with its own set of rewards, requirements and rules.
- You can find all the ongoing staking campaigns [here](https://portal.moonsama.com/staking-campaigns)

In this guide, we will use Dremica's staking campaign as an example of how to participate. To join Dremica's staking campaign, you need to have 1 Exosama NFT and 10,000 SAMA tokens.
  
1. Navigate to the [Multiverse Portal](https://portal.moonsama.com/login) and log in. If you don't have a Moonsama account yet, it'll be automatically created for you when you login for the first time.
