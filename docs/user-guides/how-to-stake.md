# How to stake?

:::note 
Staking is not possible on the Multiverse Portal in the traditional sense. It is more akin to a loyalty program. Clans can reward Portal users for holding certain mix of NFTs and tokens imported. Holders can enter or exit any time they wish.

See below for step-by-step instructions on how to participate in Moonsama's staking campaigns.

- Moonsama and Clans can host various staking campaigns within Moonsama's ecosystem.
- Ecosystem participants can join in these campaigns, each with its own set of rewards andrequirements
- You can find all the ongoing staking campaigns [here](https://portal.moonsama.com/staking)

In this guide, we will use Dremica's staking campaign as an example of how to participate. To join Dremica's staking campaign, you need to have 1 Exosama NFT and 10,000 SAMA tokens.
  
1. Navigate to the [Multiverse Portal](https://portal.moonsama.com/login) and log in. If you don't have a Moonsama account yet, it'll be automatically created for you when you login for the first time.

2. Navigate to the "My Profile" section where you can manage your inventory. From here you can import all the assets required for the staking campaign to your Moonsama account. Make sure that you are connected to the correct network!

3. After importing your assets to your Moonsama account and seeing them in your in-game items, you can now head to the "Staking" tab of the Portal.

4. If you meet the requirements of the campaign, it will let you click on the join button.
