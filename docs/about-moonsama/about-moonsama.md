# What is Moonsama

![moonsama](img/moonsama-cover.png)

Moonsama is a powerful multi-chain protocol and thriving community focused on web3 gaming. We enable developers to rapidly build applications that leverage on-chain digital assets like NFTs. What began as a passionate community project has evolved into a comprehensive platform that combines innovative technology with an engaged ecosystem of builders and players.

Our platform provides essential infrastructure and tools that accelerate blockchain application development while nurturing a community that drives innovation in the web3 gaming space.

## Why Moonsama?

While NFTs create opportunities for unique digital ownership and new value creation, developing NFT-integrated applications from scratch is complex and resource-intensive. Moonsama addresses this challenge by providing ready-made building blocks for essential NFT functionality:

- Minting, consuming and using blockchain based tokens
- Trading and marketplace tools
- Governance mechanisms
- Staking capabilities
- Cross-chain interoperability

By handling these foundational components, our infrastructure allows developers to focus on creating distinctive experiences. Whether you're developing a game, marketplace, or community platform, Moonsama significantly reduces your time from concept to launch.

### Community Management with Clans

The Moonsama Multiverse Portal empowers communities to create and manage autonomous virtual organizations called Clans. Each Clan functions as a complete organizational framework featuring:

- Community-driven governance systems
- Token-gated access to Discord and Telegram channels
- Customizable reward systems and token economies
- Dedicated staking pools and incentive structures
- NFT-based content unlocks and privileges

Clans can seamlessly integrate third-party services while leveraging the Multiverse Portal's infrastructure, allowing communities to prioritize engagement and growth rather than technical implementation.

### Experience Dremica

Dremica is home to Moonsama's signature Carnage eventsâ€”competitive sessions where players and Clans can showcase their NFTs, enjoy gameplay, and earn rewards. These events run on scheduled Sundays and welcome participation from all Clans who go through a review process.

To get involved, contact us at contact@moonsama.com or reach out to our community managers on Discord or Telegram to learn about establishing your Clan.
