# Governance

Ecosystem decisions are driven by the community through a two-layer decision-making process:

1. Informal voting through community channels
2. Formal voting through the governance portal

The current formal governance model follows a simple token voting system. Moonsama NFTs count as 1 vote each, while Exosama NFTs count as 0.1 votes each. This weighting reflects the relative supply of each collection.

### 1. Moonsama Assembly
The Moonsama Assembly, consisting of participants in the Governance channels on Telegram and Discord, determines the general sentiment of the community.

Anyone can submit proposals in these channels, and community members can vote by simply adding "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" emojis to them. This voting process serves as an indicator of community sentiment and provides a preliminary filtering mechanism for potential proposals that may later be formally ratified.

### 2. Official proposals
When a proposal garners significant community interest (indicated by more than 70 "thumbs up"), it qualifies to be formalized as an official proposal on the [Moonsama Multiverse Portal governance section](https://portal.moonsama.com/governance). Once approved through the official voting process, these proposals are ratified and implemented by the DAO President in collaboration with the Moonsama Core team.
