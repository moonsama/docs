# How to play

All information can be found on the official [Dremica website](https://www.dremica.com/article/96ffee62-b101-4296-aec7-616d7de39340).

## Tl;DR

1. Go to [Itch](https://dremica.itch.io/dremica) and download the game. Better yet, use the [Itch client](https://itch.io/app) which will always keep the game up to date.

2. Make sure you have a [Moonsama Account](https://portal.moonsama.com/) and an eligible NFT to play. The easiest way is to grab an Exosama NFT, but you can ask someone in the community to lend you one for free as well through the [Multiverse Portal](https://portal.moonsama.com/). Moonsama set up a lending pool of Exos to support new players joining without any friction.

3. Ask for information in social channels when the next session is and simply launch the game when the time arrives.
